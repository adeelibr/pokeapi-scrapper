# pokeapi-scrapper

Inspired from the very famous [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/) I have created a scrapper that gets a set of pokemon to a range data set.

I created this for a personal project for mocking some pokemon data, without having to have frequent network calls.

## Usage

- Clone the repo
- In your terminal `$ cd pokeapi-scrapper`
- In the root folder dir type `$ npm i`
- Then type `$ npm start`
- It will create a fresh bash of **50 pokemon** in the root folder by the name of **data.js**
- And that is it :) Have fun

## Advanced Usage

If you want to get more pokemon with the **pokeapi-scrapper** then do the following

`$ npm start -- --count 150`

This will get a data set of 150 pokemon
